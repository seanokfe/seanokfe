- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @seanokfe founder of embeddedOK, LLC.
- I began designing boards and writing code professionally in 2017 when I graduated from Wentworth Institute of Technology and started working as an electrical engineer at a small engineering design firm. 
- Working at a small firm, I had the opportunity to take on multiple projects throughout the year and quickly honed my skills in schematic, board, firmware, and HDL design while simultaneously learning important board bringup, testing and debug skills. 
- Engineering is important to me as it allows me to help others and bring their ideas to life. I love what I do and although sometimes finding that one issue/bug can be stressful, in the end seeing a design completed and running feels great!  
- Eventually my dream is to use my engineering skills to design a product which will help improve everyone's quality of life, although as everyone knows coming up with the product idea is the first and hardest step..
